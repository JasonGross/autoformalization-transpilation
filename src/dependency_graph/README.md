# Dependency Graph of Logical Foundations

This repository contains scripts to build a dependency graph of the Logical Foundations project.

## Instructions

1. Run the `generate_dgraph.sh` script:
    ```sh
    ./generate_dgraph.sh
    ```
    This script processes all Coq files listed in the script, generates individual dependency graphs for each file, and saves them in the specified output directory.

2. The [generate_dgraph.sh](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) script uses [depth_graph.v](http://_vscodecontentref_/1) to generate the dependency graphs for each file. The graphs are saved as `.dpd` files in the output directory.

3. After generating the individual dependency graphs, the script runs [combine_graph.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/2) to merge all individual `.dpd` files into a single [dgraph.dpd](http://_vscodecontentref_/3) file.

## File Descriptions

- **generate_dgraph.sh**: This script processes each Coq file, generates its dependency graph using [depth_graph.v](http://_vscodecontentref_/4), and saves the results in the output directory. It then runs [combine_graph.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/5) to merge the individual graphs.

- **depth_graph.v**: This Coq file is used to generate the dependency graph for a given Coq file. It uses the `dpdgraph` library to print the dependency graph.

- **dgraph.dpd**: This file contains the merged dependency graph of all processed Coq files. It is generated by [combine_graph.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/6).

- **combine_graph.py**: This script reads all individual `.dpd` files from the output directory, assigns unique global IDs to nodes, and merges the graphs into a single [dgraph.dpd](http://_vscodecontentref_/7) file.

## Additional Information

- The [generate_dgraph.sh](http://_vscodecontentref_/8) script creates temporary Coq files for each file being processed, runs `coqc` to generate the dependency graph, and then cleans up the temporary files.

- The [combine_graph.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/9) script ensures that each node in the final graph has a unique global ID and preserves the attributes and edges from the individual graphs.

By following these instructions, you can generate and merge dependency graphs for the Logical Foundations project.
